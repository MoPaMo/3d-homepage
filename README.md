I created sun-earth-fastmoon using the A-Frame tutorial. (First ever A-Frame project). I initially wanted to create a 3D personal homepage but rearranged mid-project to create a sun earth moon sim. (Only downside: moon is hella fast and I couldnâ€™t fix it haha)

Here's a gif with 7 FPS cause GIFs are kinda weird
